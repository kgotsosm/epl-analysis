# English Premier League Analysis for Predicting Match Winners

**This repository contains an analysis of the English Premier League (EPL) aimed at developing a machine learning model to predict the winners of EPL matches. 
The project incorporates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training. I did the data cleaning, and analysis as well as preparation for the machine learning portion of the project, which was completed with the assistance of various online sources.
The goal is to provide insights into the EPL and create a reliable predictor for future matches.**

To get started with the English Premier League Analysis for Predictor, follow the steps below:

### Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/epl-analysis.git


### Data
The data used in this analysis is found in the matches.csv file. You can replace this sample dataset with your own EPL data for analysis and prediction.

### Analysis
The analysis consists of several steps, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering. The epl-winners.ipynb notebook provides detailed information on how the data is cleaned and prepared for analysis.

### Model Training
The notebookn also shows the training of a machine learning model to predict the winners of EPL matches. This part of the notebook was not completed from my own knowledge but with the help of a number of online sources. It includes feature selection, model evaluation, and fine-tuning for better performance. Different machine learning algorithms and techniques can be explored and compared within this notebook.

### Usage
The main purpose of this project is to facilitate the development of a predictor for EPL matches. After going through the data cleaning, EDA, and model training steps, you can utilize the trained model to predict the outcomes of future EPL matches.
